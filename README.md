# Armstrong-numbers-generator
This is a simple Armstrong numbers generator in Python. 
It is set to range 1-10**7 by default, which gives you 24 numbers in about 30sec - but you can easily adjust that if you want (it will just take longer to finish the program, for example 10**8 will give you 27 numbers in about 5-7 minutes)
